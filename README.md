# final-project-cyberpolice

- lsbv1.py (Eric) and lsbv2.py (Caleb) were our initial LSB (least significant bit) algorithms which used different extraction methods. We decided not to use either of them once dct.py was developed.
- dct.py (Eric) was an improvement on the embedding algorithm which moved the data from the spatial to the frequence domain.
- dctecc.py (Travis) is an extension of dct.py which added bch (cyclic error correcting codes) and repetition error correction to the data.
- scraper.py (Caleb) is the webscraper and gui used in the demo.
- test_dct.py (Eric) is the script used for testing compression.
- watermark.py (Travis) is a different version of the lsb scripts that allows you to choose where to place an image inside of another image.
