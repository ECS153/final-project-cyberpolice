Travis:
1. Researched steganography and read research papers 
2. Find and read research papers more carefully and figure out steganography algorithms and storage method, make 3 minute video

3. N/A

Caleb:
1. Researched potential project topics
2. Look into the research papers, identify exactly what we are encoding into images, who can verify if an image has a watermark, and how public/private key architecture might fit into it.
3. N/A

Action Items
* Figure out how our project would work in a real world model
* Figure out what algorithm to use for steganography
